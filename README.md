# MVP Studio Onboarding Project - React.js Dashboard 
A simple web app dashboard using React.JS that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on a typical web store database - Customer, Product, Stores, and Sales tables.

## This app is built using:
* **ASP.NET Core** and **C#** for cross-platform server-side code.
* **React.js** for client-side code.
* **react-bootstrap** React for layout and styling.
* **Azure SQL** Database for the backend database.
* react-axios libraries for AJAX calls.
