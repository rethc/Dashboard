# MVP Studio Software Developer Onboarding Project- React.js Dashboard 
A simple dashboard in React.JS with the Customer, Product, Stores, and Sales tables.

Welcome to my react web application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on an SQL database. 

## This app is built using:
* **ASP.NET Core** and **C#** for cross-platform server-side code.
* **React.js** for client-side code.
* **react-bootstrap** React for layout and styling.
* **Azure SQL** Database for the backend database.
* react-axios libraries for AJAX calls.
